ancrel.4104.desc;Curses! The Nile flood is paltry and weak this year. Egyptians everywhere worry, as the harvest might be inadequate, leading to hunger and even starvation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_garlic_distribution_desc;Garlic was a highly revered crop and important to the ancient Egyptians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_planted_palm_trees;Planted Palm Trees;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_planted_palm_trees_desc;Seeking to emulate the ancient Egyptians, the ruler of this province has ordered the planting of palm trees for shade, good luck, and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_khnum_amulet;Amulet of Khnum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_khnum_amulet_desc;This character possesses an amulet of the Egyptian pagan god Khnum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_province_desecrated_egyptian_tombs;Ancient Tombs Desecrated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_province_desecrated_egyptian_tombs_desc;Somebody's been ransacking ancient tombs in this province... the gods will punish them in the afterlife. Hopefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_not_upholding_maat;Not Upholding Ma'at;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_not_upholding_maat_desc;"You're a terrible ruler! You should be ashamed of yourself! When your heart is judged by Osiris in the afterlife, he shall see the imbalance in your Ma'at and you will be thrown to the terrible beast Ammit!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4150.desc;In olden times, the people of Egypt valued that most wonderful and delicious vegetable, garlic. It pleased the Gods and was used to take oaths. Perhaps it would be a good idea to order large quantities to garlic to be distributed to the temples scattered across our realm!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4150.a;Yes, let's do it. Praise be to the Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4150.b;No, this sounds silly, and we do not have the resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4151.desc;The powerful men and women of ancient Egypt often planted palm trees not just for their dates, but to provide good shade in their palaces and temples. I feel as if it would be wise if I did the same to my residence and the nearby temples. If anything, I can show many my power and remind them of the splendor of the old Egyptians!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4151.a;Let us plant the trees, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4151.b;Perhaps I should not, this seems vain and pointless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4152.desc;An important and influential member of the local community in your capital has given you an beautifully crafted gold amulet dedicated to the god Khnum. As controller of the Nile, he brings fortune to all and is not to be ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4152.a;Thank you! May this amulet help me in this life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4153.desc;Ill news! Lately it seems a crafty band of robbers have been breaking into various tombs in [Root.GetName], desecrating corpses and making away with whatever riches they can find. How now will the dead be able to properly protect their descendants, much less live contentedly in the afterlife with Osiris? This is a shame, indeed, and nothing but a shame!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4153.a;Hopefully local security will catch these brigands…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4153.b;We will provide some aid to protect any unplundered tombs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4154.desc;In my dream I was surrounded by evil spirits. I was lost. I was scared. I fell to despair, I lost hope. But then came the god Bes, that dwarf-god of grotesque appearance, and I saw him as he took out his swords and knives and waved them like a soldier, to ward off the demons. I saw as he took out his musical instruments and played loud songs to frighten them. As I awoke, I felt at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4154.a;As he protected the Pharaohs of old, so has he protected me just now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4155.desc;I feel that despite my many good deeds, there are is still Isfet - evil - within me that must be purged, for I have certainly done sinful things as a ruler. If my heart is out of balance with Ma’at, then in the afterlife I will be devoured by the terrible beast Ammit and I will have no chance of a peaceful immortality. Thus, I desire to find a good sorcerer-priest, who knows how to alleviate me of this worry!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4155.a;I must ensure my place in the afterlife!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4155.b;On second thought, all this talk of “evil” and the afterlife is stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.tooltip;Off to the temple we go.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.title;Expel the Evil in my Heart;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.desc;The sorcerer-priest understands my worries, and knows the right incantation for my situation. He thus begins to chant in my presence:\n\n"I am bringing the gods incense and natron.\nI want to expel the bad smell from your mouth.\nTherefore I come in order to expel the evil in your hearts.\nWith this I remove the Evil, Isfet, which clings to you.\nWith this I bring you Good.\nI present Justice, Maat, to you......";;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.a;I begin to feel relieved as my soul is cleansed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4157.desc;The peasants you rule over believe that no matter what hardships they face, your rule has maintained the balance of Ma'at - justice, goodness, the natural order - in the realm. They praise you for your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4157.a;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4158.desc;Regardless of whether they are right or wrong, the peasants you rule over believe that due to your style of rule, you unfortunately have been unable to maintain the balance of Ma'at - justice, goodness, the natural order - in the realm. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4158.a;They don't understand! Don't understand at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4159.desc;To honor the traditions of the ancient Egyptians, many women in the region have taken to adopting pet cats, for they represent feminine fertility and sensuality. One day while lounging with your wife, you notice she is playing with one of her cats, and you can’t help but notice as she watches you she is looking at you in a rather seductive, cat-like manner, and suddenly you feel as if you want to learn more about this cat-like fertility and sensuality in a more practical, hands-on sense...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4159.a;Come here, kitty…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4160.desc;A heinous crime! The wretched criminal is brought before you, and few in your court can bear to look at the deviant, lawless, inhuman evil-doer. He will be punished severely for his deed, of course, that is without a doubt. You tell the man his sentence, and your guards take him away to execute him shortly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4160.a;Terrible! To think he murdered a cat, even by accident! An unforgivable crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4160.b;Come now, it's just a cat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_stupid_cat_lovers_boooo;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4161.desc;The ancient Egyptians put anyone who killed a cat - even accidentally - to death immediately. Their justice was swift and vengeful, and so is yours. The cat is sacred, are they not, particularly to the great Goddess Bast? May the criminal’s blood be adequate satisfaction for the great Goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIET_heard_about_apollo_prank_desc;This character has heard a funny story about a prank a god supposedly pulled on another one.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4200.desc;The story of Proserpina’s abduction by Pluto has interested you as of late. Pluto seems like a calm, stoic type who justly dispenses judgment over the souls of the dead without bias and isn’t a philanderer like his brothers, so you wonder as to why he would have acted so rashly. Is there more to the story than meets the eye?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4200.a;Nah, it was as they say. He had his way with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4200.b;Maybe Pluto conspired with Proserpina and the abduction was an excuse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4200.c;Perhaps a poet exaggerated the story for unnecessary drama.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4200.d;Sometimes I wonder what sort of history Pluto and Ceres had...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4200.tooltip.1;\n\nThat mischievous Cupid is to blame, having shot the arrow that made Pluto obsessed. Proserpina was beautiful and Pluto was lonely and desperate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4200.tooltip.2;\n\nOr maybe the two of them conspired with Ceres! Who knows - maybe they needed to protect Proserpina from the philandering Jupiter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4200.tooltip.3;\n\nAfter all, Pluto is one of the most faithful Gods, so he doesn't seem the type to kidnap fair maidens. Maybe Pluto was just socially awkward but the poets wanted a more sensational story.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4200.tooltip.4;\n\nWhat if Ceres secretly loved Pluto? What if her anguish at losing her daughter was actually anguish at her unrequited love for Pluto, but she was too embarrassed to admit it so she made up the story about Prosperina’s abduction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4201.tooltip.0;\n\nShe probably knows best after all and it would be improper if not blasphemous of me to make arbitrary assumptions about her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4201.desc;You ponder on the stories surrounding Apollo and Diana and how protective they were of one another. Orion died because Apollo feared Diana would break her vow of chastity. Meanwhile, Diana killed Apollo's lover Coronis when she cheated on him. It sounds like a kind of jealousy snd protectiveness, doesn’t it? You start to wonder whether the twins are closer than they appear... ;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4201.a;Nah, probably just siblings who care about each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4201.b;Aha! Diana's “virgin” status makes much more sense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4201.c;Haha, that's a good one. What are we, Zoroastrians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4201.d;Maybe I could ask the goddess herself, since she likes me…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4202.tooltip;\n\nI would like to, ah, have a more hands-on demonstration of what transpired between her and Jupiter. For the sake of fair judgement, of course. But not when her husband is around, of course. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4202.desc;A local nobleman recently accused his wife of adultery. He says her newborn child is not his. She claims, however, that Lord Jupiter came down from the heavens and had his way with her and that while she did not want to be unfaithful, it would have been unwise for her to resist the powerful god. She is an extremely attractive young woman, so it wouldn't be impossible… right? Unable to resolve the dispute, they come to you for judgment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4202.a;I'm sorry, but how is this supposed to be my problem?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4202.b;Haha, good one. Adulteresses have always used that excuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4202.c;Clearly this is a child of Jupiter! Treat him well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4202.d;Why doesn’t she show me what Jupiter did to her…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4203.desc;While visiting a town you notice a beggar's corpse lying by the road. The locals said he recently died but otherwise ignore the corpse, saying someone will clean it up eventually. You notice the poor beggar doesn't even have the two coins needed to give to Charon in the afterlife so that he may be able to travel to the underworld without hassle.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4203.a;I will give the corpse two of my own gold pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4203.b;It's not my business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4204.desc;A man comes to your residence, asking to let him stay the night. His face is kindly but he wears the tattered, ragged clothes of a vagrant. As a follower of the gods it is your duty to show Xenia, or hospitality, but realistically speaking he could be a troublemaking hoodlum or even an assassin for all you know...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4204.a;We must show Xenia. Let him in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4204.b;Be rid of him. What if he's a thief?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4205.desc;In a dream, the king of gods, Jupiter, appears before you. Thunderclouds surround him and he is angry. "How dare you refuse me, arrogant swine! Have you forgotten Xenia?" You recoil in horror, realizing that beggar you rudely turned away was Jupiter in disguise!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4205.a;Have mercy! Don't curse me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4206.desc;In a dream, the king of gods, Jupiter, appears before you. He sits on a throne, smiling. As you supplicate before him, he says, "You were wise to show hospitality to me. You know Xenia, mortal." You realize that the beggar you accepted into your abode was Jupiter in disguise!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4206.a;O thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4207.desc;While taking a walk you come across some maidens bathing in the stream. Embarrassed, you try to sneak away but they notice you. Giggling, they call you over, and you can't help but be entranced by their beauty and their sweet voices.... Ah! They must be local nymphs!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4207.a;Don't mind if I join in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4207.b;No. I am loyal to my beloved and will resist the temptation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4207.c;I have no interest with these giggly airheads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4207.d;I will entertain you, but no naughty business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4208.desc;You come by a village engaging in the “pharmakos” ceremony, wherein a chosen man - usually a criminal, beggar, cripple, slave, or some other undesirable - is ritually beaten and then exiled. The village recently went through some rough times, and the ceremony will supposedly help the villagers gain the favor of the gods and restore their fortunes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4208.a;Interesting. Carry on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4208.b;Stop this! This is clearly a silly superstition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4209.desc;One of your servants discovered a so-called “curse tablet” lying in a grave near your residence. Alarmingly, the writing on the tablet was an invocation of the dead spirits of the grave, as well as the gods of the underworld - Pluto and Proserpina - to bring misery and misfortune upon you. You have the priests properly dispose of the item, but you can’t help but feel uneasy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4209.a;Oh no! Heavens have mercy on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4209.b;It’s just mere superstition at the end of the day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4209.c;There is nothing to fear from some stupid piece of writing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4210.desc;You recently discovered one of your maids trying to write a binding spell addressed to Venus - a love spell, in other words. Surprisingly, the spell targeted you. She wanted you, her lord, to fall in love with her! Though binding spells are typically thought of as something men would do, it is not unheard of for women to try using them. And your beautiful maid is young, naive, and at your complete mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4210.a;This is ridiculous. Why do I put up with this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4210.b;You know, you’re very pretty, and I can teach you many things, darling...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4210.c;She shall be punished for this witchcraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4210.d;I’m flattered, but I am your lord and you are a mere maid. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4210.tooltip.1;\n\nHer face is beet red as she promises not to make anymore trouble, and you both agree to pretend this never happened.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.4210.tooltip.4;\n\nYou gently tell her that she is being silly. “Someday you’ll find a good husband,” you tell her in a brotherly tone. “I can help you find one in the future, if you want.”;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.4211.desc;You recently discovered one of your young servant boys trying to write a binding spell addressed to Venus - a love spell, in other words. Surprisingly, the spell targeted you. He wanted you to fall in love with him! You didn’t expect this from him, as he is shy and gentle, so it seems he learned about these spells from older peers. And your handsome servant is young, naive, and at your complete mercy...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4211.a;This is ridiculous. Why do I put up with this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4211.b;You know, you’re very cute, and I can teach you many things, darling...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4211.c;He shall be punished for this witchcraft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4211.d;I’m flattered, but I am your mistress and you are a mere servant. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4211.tooltip.1;\n\nHis face is beet red as he promises not to make anymore trouble, and you both agree to pretend this never happened.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4211.tooltip.2;\n\nSeems like his love spell worked after all. And there’s nothing like seducing an innocent young boy and making him all yours.;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.4211.tooltip.4;\n\nYou gently tell him he is being silly. “Someday you’ll find a good wife,” you tell him in a sisterly tone. “I can help you find one in the future, if you want.”;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.4212.desc;One of your prisoners - an insignificant, elderly peasant - was starving and frail due to his advanced age and the conditions of his confinement, but his young daughter snuck into the prison every night, breastfeeding him so he could survive. For such a display of pietas, filial duty, many in your court say that the father should be given a pardon! The gods would be proud!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4212.a;Yes. Clearly the gods have blessed them. Release him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4212.b;Yes - and furthermore, I will give them public support for life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4212.c;No. I do not care what the gods think. The law will not allow this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4212.d;No. What more, I shall execute them for their disrespect to my authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4213.desc;Rumors abound that a powerful nymph resides in one of your realm’s provinces. She was said to once be the wife and lover of a kind and wise lord who once ruled the area. Though he, a mortal, has since long passed, her spirit remains to this day and blesses the province every now and then with fortune and abundance.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4213.a;Interesting… maybe I’ll get to meet her one day?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4214.desc;A courtier comes before you, asking for intervention in a family dispute. Apparently his son is a devout worshipper of Cybele, the great mother goddess. Like many of her followers, the son wishes to castrate himself and serve her for the rest of his life as a Galli, the castrated priests of Cybele. However, the father says that it is the son's duty to continue the family line.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4214.a;The father is right. Filial duty is as important as proper worship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4214.b;The son is right. His faith is admirable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4214.c;They should ask an oracle for advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4215.desc;Near your capital a new village is being founded, and you are attending the opening ceremony. The villagers make a hole, the leptis manialis, said to represent the gateway to the underworld, and one that is dug each time a village is founded. As the highest ranking dignitary, you are the first to leave an offering of fruit in the hole.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4215.a;May the gods bless this town for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4216.desc;One of your courtiers, while out hunting, seems to have accidentally killed an animal in one of Diana's sacred groves! The man is afraid of divine retribution.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4216.a;Pray to Diana for mercy and admit your mistakes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4216.b;Probably not a big deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4217.desc;An important nobleman in your realm has recently married a great beauty who seems to have appeared out of nowhere. She is graceful and kind, clever and friendly, and claims to be a noblewoman from elsewhere. Rumor has it that she was a local nymph who fell in love with the him and decided to take on the form of a mortal woman! What a lucky fellow.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4217.a;He must have pleased Venus and Cupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4218.desc;Lightning recently struck one of the trees on your residence. It was an otherwise clear day with nary a sign of cloud or rain. Your soothsayers say that this was clearly a sign from the gods, which they then interpreted as a good omen. Your courtiers have already begun to treat the tree as a “fanaticus,” a sacred tree blessed by the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4218.a;Good to hear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4219.desc;The ancient Latins regarded the ancient hero Ulysses as nothing more than a coward who manipulated and deceived those around him. The ancient Hellenes, on the other hand, who knew him as Odysseus, believed that his cunning was an admirable trait showing his resourcefulness and wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4219.a;The Latins are right - Ulysses is a chicken-hearted liar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4219.b;The Greeks are right - Odysseus is brave and intelligent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4219.c;Who cares? He’s long dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4220.tooltip;\n\nAnd unlike his philandering brothers, Pluto is a good and faithful husband, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4220.desc;One of your courtiers is extremely drunk. So drunk, in fact, that he suddenly declares that he shall rescue Prosperina from the evil Pluto! Everyone rolls their eyes at such blasphemy. The courtier then asks you, his liege, to assist him in this effort. Together, you both will travel to the underworld and save Prosperina from her dark husband. You shake your head and tell him to watch his mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4220.a;No one insults the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4221.desc;You have angered Pluto and Prosperina with your blasphemous claims!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4221.a;Oh no! I don’t want to go to Tartarus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4222.title;Hades Aidoneus;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4222.desc;In your dreams, a man and woman appear before you. They are dark and brooding, but do not seem malevolent. The woman is young - barely an adult - and has golden tresses that frames her pale, beautiful face. The man is tall and stern, lean and handsome.\n\nHe speaks first: “Your friend shall be punished for his blasphemous proclamation. Only a fool tries to steal my wife from the underworld, and he shall suffer in Tartarus. But you rightly warned him. For your wisdom, I, Lord Pluto, and my wife, Queen Prosperina, shall grant you our blessings.”\n\nThe next morning, your courtier is found dead for no apparent reason.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4222.a;Lord Pluto is just… my courtier’s hubris led to his downfall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4222.b;I hope Prosperina will appeal to Pluto for mercy on my courtier’s soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4223.desc;You are sitting with your courtiers, having idle conversation. They are discussing the Trojan War and how it all started when Venus, Juno, and Minerva competed to see which one of them was the loveliest of all. Your courtiers begin debating which of the three goddesses was truly the most beautiful. Paris may have chosen Venus, but who would you have chosen?;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4223.a;Venus of course. She's the goddess of beauty after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4223.b;Juno, I think. A true beauty is regal and maternal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4223.c;Minerva in my opinion. Intelligence is very attractive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4223.d;I'm a woman. Why should I care? Stupid men and their fantasies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4223.e;I don't care. Now between Apollo, Jupiter, Mars, I'd choose…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4224.desc;Later that night, in your dreams, a woman appears before you. She is physically perfect - from her body to her face to the aura that emanates from her - and every part of her is desirable. She is no doubt Venus, goddess of love and beauty, and you prostrate before her. She laughs and tells you that you made the right choice is saying she was the most beautiful of all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4224.a;“To think Juno and Minerva could compete with me, the goddess of beauty!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4225.desc;Later that night, in your dreams, a woman appears before you. She is beautiful, but in a dignified manner befitting that of a queen. Queen? You realize that she is none other than Juno, queen of the gods! As you bow to her, she says that she was rather pleased when you said that she was the most beautiful of all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4225.a;“Indeed, Venus and Minerva are but silly little girls!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4226.desc;Later that night, in your dreams, a woman appears before you. She is a young maiden of incomparable beauty. She wears a full suit of armor, and wields a spear. You realize that she is the great Minerva! As you pay your respects, she explains that you were wise in arguing that she was the most beautiful of all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4226.a;“That Venus is such a bimbo, you know that?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4227.desc;Someone suggested that I build some more herma in the area around my residence. In olden days, the herma were a rectangular column with the head of a deity on top (usually Hermes) and a phallus carved into the column. They are said to bring good luck and fortune.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4227.a;Yes, good idea - we’ll show our devotion to Hermes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4227.b;Phallic statues? Are you kidding me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4228.desc;While visiting a local town my entourage and I pass by a large statue of Priapus, the old god of fertility. Like most statues of the god, he is depicted an oversized, exaggerated member, everyone is supposed to touch in order to call for the god’s blessings. If anyone angered Priapus, it is said that he would threaten to sexually assault them, regardless of gender or age or background.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4228.a;I duly touch the statue’s phallus and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4228.b;Ew, I am not touching that disgusting thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4229.desc;Every now and then you pay homage to your family’s Lares, the local guardian deities who have protected your dynasty since time immemorial. It is important you honor them with sacrifices and offerings, so that they may provide help in times of need. You approach the lararium, the shrine where the small statue of the Lar is placed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4229.a;Salve lar familiaris!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
