VIET_not_upholding_maat_desc;"You're a terrible ruler! You should be ashamed of yourself! When your heart is judged by Osiris in the afterlife, he shall see the imbalance in your Ma'at and you will be thrown to the terrible beast Ammit!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4150.desc;In olden times, the people of Egypt valued that most wonderful and delicious vegetable, garlic. It pleased the Gods and was used to take oaths. Perhaps it would be a good idea to order large quantities to garlic to be distributed to the temples scattered across our realm!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4150.a;Yes, let's do it. Praise be to the Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4150.b;No, this sounds silly, and we do not have the resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4151.desc;The powerful men and women of ancient Egypt often planted palm trees not just for their dates, but to provide good shade in their palaces and temples. I feel as if it would be wise if I did the same to my residence and the nearby temples. If anything, I can show many my power and remind them of the splendor of the old Egyptians!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4151.a;Let us plant the trees, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4151.b;Perhaps I should not, this seems vain and pointless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4152.desc;An important and influential member of the local community in your capital has given you an beautifully crafted gold amulet dedicated to the god Khnum. As controller of the Nile, he brings fortune to all and is not to be ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4152.a;Thank you! May this amulet help me in this life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4153.desc;Ill news! Lately it seems a crafty band of robbers have been breaking into various tombs in [Root.GetName], desecrating corpses and making away with whatever riches they can find. How now will the dead be able to properly protect their descendants, much less live contentedly in the afterlife with Osiris? This is a shame, indeed, and nothing but a shame!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4153.a;Hopefully local security will catch these brigands…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4153.b;We will provide some aid to protect any unplundered tombs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4154.desc;In my dream I was surrounded by evil spirits. I was lost. I was scared. I fell to despair, I lost hope. But then came the god Bes, that dwarf-god of grotesque appearance, and I saw him as he took out his swords and knives and waved them like a soldier, to ward off the demons. I saw as he took out his musical instruments and played loud songs to frighten them. As I awoke, I felt at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4154.a;As he protected the Pharaohs of old, so has he protected me just now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4155.desc;I feel that despite my many good deeds, there are is still Isfet - evil - within me that must be purged, for I have certainly done sinful things as a ruler. If my heart is out of balance with Ma’at, then in the afterlife I will be devoured by the terrible beast Ammit and I will have no chance of a peaceful immortality. Thus, I desire to find a good sorcerer-priest, who knows how to alleviate me of this worry!;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4155.a;I must ensure my place in the afterlife!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4155.b;On second thought, all this talk of “evil” and the afterlife is stupid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.tooltip;Off to the temple we go.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.title;Expel the Evil in my Heart;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.desc;The sorcerer-priest understands my worries, and knows the right incantation for my situation. He thus begins to chant in my presence:\n\n"I am bringing the gods incense and natron.\nI want to expel the bad smell from your mouth.\nTherefore I come in order to expel the evil in your hearts.\nWith this I remove the Evil, Isfet, which clings to you.\nWith this I bring you Good.\nI present Justice, Maat, to you......";;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4156.a;I begin to feel relieved as my soul is cleansed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4157.desc;The peasants you rule over believe that no matter what hardships they face, your rule has maintained the balance of Ma'at - justice, goodness, the natural order - in the realm. They praise you for your efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4157.a;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4158.desc;Regardless of whether they are right or wrong, the peasants you rule over believe that due to your style of rule, you unfortunately have been unable to maintain the balance of Ma'at - justice, goodness, the natural order - in the realm. ;;;;;;;;;;;x

ancrel.4159.desc;To honor the traditions of the ancient Egyptians, many women in the region have taken to adopting pet cats, for they represent feminine fertility and sensuality. One day while lounging with your wife, you notice she is playing with one of her cats, and you can’t help but notice as she watches you she is looking at you in a rather seductive, cat-like manner, and suddenly I feel as if I want to learn more about this cat-like fertility and sensuality in a more practical, hands-on sense...;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4159.a;Come here, kitty…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4160.desc;A heinous crime! The wretched criminal is brought before you, and few in your court can bear to look at the deviant, lawless, inhuman evil-doer. He will be punished severely for his deed, of course, that is without a doubt. You tell the man his sentence, and your guards take him away to execute him shortly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4160.a;Terrible! To think he murdered a cat, even by accident! An unforgivable crime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_stupid_cat_lovers_boooo;xxxxx;;;;;;;;;;;x
ancrel.4161.desc;The ancient Egyptians put anyone who killed a cat - even accidentally - to death immediately. Their justice was swift and vengeful, and so is yours. The cat is sacred, are they not, particularly to the great Goddess Bast? May the criminal’s blood be adequate satisfaction for the great Goddess.;;;;;;;;;;;x
